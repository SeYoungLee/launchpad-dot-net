# Launchpad.NET
*The easy way to create applications for the NOVATION Launchpad*

**Welcome to LAUNCHPAD.NET**  
This is a simple C# library which allows you to interact with the NOVATION LAUNCHPAD.  
You can view the GitHub Wiki over here, in order to learn how the functions work together.  
This is only possible because of **jstnryan** and his https://github.com/jstnryan/midi-dot-net  

**Features**  
This comes with a few features right now, but I will extend this in the future!
 + Automatic MIDI Device sorting (you only see Launchpads, not other MIDI devices
 + Easy LED state setting (set LEDs only giving coordinates and velocity)
 + LED rect filling (with start and end coordinates)
 + Easy handling of Launchpads with a own class for Launchpad
 + Easy connecting / disconnecting  

**Bugs?**  
No problem, thats why GitHub is here. :joy:
